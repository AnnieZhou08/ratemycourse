# List of Unknowns and Risks

### Unknowns:
1. Web crawling (www.courses.students.ubc.ca) to get course information: course code and course name (for now)
2. Facebook SDK connecting with Android SDK to get user's friends (Facebook friends id : unique)
3. Firebase authentication : UBC Email - authenticate whether it's a ubc student

### Risks:
1. Might not be able to crawl web to get the course information
2. Not sure about the project flow on SDK connection and user login (user shouldn't need facebook to use the app)
-> should be : create an account and login -> after login connect with facebook; if not connected, cannot see coruse page
